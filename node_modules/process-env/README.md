## Install

```
$ npm install --save process-env
```

## Usage

Process ENV allows you to not only get your environment variables, but also set them in your scripts, or even load a `.env` file which will set variables for you.

```js
import env from 'process-env'

env.get('path'); // returns: /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin

```

You can set a variable by passing the value you want as a second parameter.

```js
env.set('path', '/usr/bin');
```

By default it does not overwrite any pre-existing variables either as part of the environment being ran in, or loaded by the `.env` file.

To overwrite any pre-existing variable, pass `true` as the 3rd argument.

```js
env.set('path', '/usr/bin', true);
```

By default we check for a `.env` file and load that if it exists, but you can load your own file if you'd like. For example, create a file called `my.env` and put the contents below inside.

```
NODE_APP=My-App
APP_VERSION=1.0.0
```

Then you can load it like:

```js
env.load('./my.env');
```

Now when you do `env.get('node_app');` you will see `My-App`.

As you can see, all examples reference variables in lowercase. That doesn't matter, as internally we `.toUpperCase()` on the key to make sure all variables are uppercased as they should be.

## Testing

```
$ npm test
```
